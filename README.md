# Aerophobia Exposure Therapy

The user experience encompasses being a passenger on a commercial flight in several scenarios: on the runway, during takeoff, in the sky, during a storm and going through turbulence.

The game is destined for people with aerophobia (fear of flying) and is meant to expose the user gradually to different levels of difficulty, in order to defeat their fear.
